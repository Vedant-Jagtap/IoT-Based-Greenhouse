# 🌱 IoT-Based Greenhouse Monitoring & Control System

## 📘 Project Overview

The **IoT-Based Greenhouse Monitoring & Control System** is a smart agriculture solution designed to monitor and automate key environmental and soil parameters inside a greenhouse.
The project leverages **IoT technology and ESP32** to collect real-time sensor data and control actuators automatically, improving crop health, resource efficiency, and reducing manual labor.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional greenhouse management faces several challenges:

* **Manual Monitoring**
  Continuous human intervention is required to monitor temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.

* **Resource Wastage**
  Overwatering or under-watering due to lack of real-time data results in water and energy loss.

* **Poor Air Management**
  Uncontrolled humidity or CO₂ levels negatively affect plant growth.

* **Lack of Data Logging**
  Absence of historical data prevents performance analysis and improvement.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

To address these issues, the project implements an **ESP32-based IoT system** that:

* Continuously monitors environmental and soil parameters
* Automatically controls actuators such as water pumps, fans, and lights
* Provides **real-time monitoring** via a mobile/web dashboard
* Sends alerts during critical environmental conditions
* Improves energy and water efficiency through intelligent automation
